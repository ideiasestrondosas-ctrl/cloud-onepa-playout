# Release Notes v2.1.1-PRO (2026-01-26)

## 🛠️ Stability & Mission Critical Fixes

- **White Screen Eradication**: Fixed all reported "White Screen" crashes in the EPG Timeline and Media Library metadata dialogs using robust optional chaining and defensive state initialization.
- **Dependency Persistence**: Ensured critical icons (`WizardIcon`/`AutoFixHigh`) and APIs (`mediaAPI`) are correctly imported to prevent component failures.
- **Settings Integrity**: Guaranteed persistence for the "EPG Days Ahead" field and optimized multi-tab save operations to prevent data loss.

## 📅 EPG Intelligence 2.0

- **Rich Tooltips**: EPG timeline now displays **Director**, **Rating**, **Genre**, and truncated **Synopsis** on hover for instant program discovery.
- **Metadata Transparency**: Added source tracking (Source Service & URL) to the Program Details popup, showing exactly where EPG data originated (TMDB/OMDb/TVMaze).
- **Synchronized Popups**: The "Detalhes da Programação" dialog now uses full database records with high-quality posters fetched directly from APIs.

## 📜 Documentation & Environment

- **Hardware Specs**: Documented official development (MacBook Pro M4) and testing (Proxmox Xeon) environments in the README for environment-specific support.
- **Dynamic History**: The in-app release history is now dynamically linked to the project archive, ensuring users always see the latest milestones.
