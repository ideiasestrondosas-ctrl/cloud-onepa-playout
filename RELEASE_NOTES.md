# Release Notes v1.8.2-EXP

## 🚀 Enhancements & Fixes

### 📺 Dashboard & Live Preview

- **Stabilization Fix**: Resolved a critical `ReferenceError: useCallback is not defined` crash that prevented the Dashboard from loading in production builds.
- **LUFS Meter**: Restored real-time audio analysis using the Web Audio API. The meter now dynamically displays audio levels (Green/Yellow/Red) directly from the HLS stream.
- **VLC Integration**:
  - Fixed the "Open VLC" button to use a direct HTTP URL (`http://[host]:[port]/hls/stream.m3u8`) instead of the unreliable `vlc://` protocol.
  - Added extensive console diagnostics for tracking VLC launch attempts (Platform, User Agent, Source URL).

### ⚙️ Backend & Settings

- **Clips Counter**: Added a persistent `clips_played_today` counter to the Settings, tracking the number of clips played daily.
- **HLS Link**: Added a direct "Link HLS (VLC/Mobile)" in the Settings page for easy access to the stream URL.
- **Asset Management**: Fixed an issue where clearing default media assets didn't correctly persist `NULL` values to the database.

### 🛠️ Technical

- **Audio Context Management**: Implemented proper cleanup for `AudioContext` and `animationFrame` to prevent memory leaks in the Dashboard.
- **Code Optimization**: Re-introduced `useCallback` and `useRef` for optimized performance in high-frequency UI updates.
